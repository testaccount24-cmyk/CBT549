//*   The program has been tested on OS/390 V2R10 and z/OS V1R3.    *   FILE 549

//*   ESA days and the EDTINFO since OS/390 V2R6 (or earlier) there *   FILE 549
//*   is no reason why the program won't work on version 2.6 and    *   FILE 549
//*   above.                                                        *   FILE 549
